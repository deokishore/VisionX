                        <article>
                        	<p>All of our products are formulated with sensitive and allergy-prone skin in mind.  We carefully select ingredients with proven remedial and skin soothing properties and keep our products free from irritating chemicals and alcohol.
                        </p>

                        	<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Transparency</strong></h3>
                        	<p>If you have highly reactive or sensitive skin, then it is important to know exactly what is in your skin care products. That's why all of our products are certified organic by the Soil Association, so you can be reassured our products stand up to scrutiny. 
</p>
							<p>You won't find "parfum" on any of our ingredient lists - a term that legally allows manufacturers to include up to 200 synthetic chemicals, including phthalates, in their products without declaring them on the label.</p>
							<p>
Tamaar was the first skin care company to list all ingredients in plain English, so you don't need a chemistry degree to understand what's in the bottle.

							<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Our Unique Products</strong></h3>
                        	<p>Unlike many brands on the market, which commission factories to both formulate and manufacture their products, we have our own in-house R&amp;D lab and manufacturing facility. That means each and every Pai Skincare product is unique and the result of our own hard work, dedicated research and rigorous testing. 
</p>
							<p>Our professional team of formulation chemists are constantly sourcing and testing new natural-active ingredients so that we can develop high performance products without compromising on purity.</p>
